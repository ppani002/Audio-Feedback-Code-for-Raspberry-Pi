# Audio-Feedback-Code-for-Raspberry-Pi
This is the C code I wrote for an audio feedback system project for SkillCourt (Senior Design Project). The networking portion of the code was written together with another team mate. The code works by using the WiringPi library to call an ISR upon a button press. When pressed, the ISR will create a child process, which is an audio player called through a Linux distro on the Raspberry Pi. Upon pressing the button again, the process is killed and a new child process is created again. The networking portion of the code is done using a state machine to check states of connectivity and data received. This data determines the audio played when the ISR is called, and this data is received via an android phone application. This folder purely shows my contributions to the project and my method of writing code. Portions of the code is intentionally left out.
